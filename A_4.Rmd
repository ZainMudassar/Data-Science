## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


a. (10 pts) Filter the dataset (using a left join) to display the tail number, year,
month, day, hour, origin, and humidity for all flights heading to Tampa
International Airport (TPA) on the afternoon of November 1, 2013.
```{r Q1a}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)



left_join_table<-left_join(flights,weather)%>%
select(origin,year,month,day,hour,tailnum,humid,year,dest)%>%
  filter(dest=="TPA" & month==11 & year==2013 & day==1 & hour>=12)


left_join_table







```

b. (10 pts) What is the difference between the following two joins?
anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))
```{r Q1b}
anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))

```
## Answer:
anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) shows us flights which do not exists in Airport column 'faa' destination.
anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest")) shows us airports which are not in flight dest column.


# Q1c. (10 pts)
Select the origin and destination airports and their latitude and longitude
for all fights in the dataset (using one or more inner joins). Hint: There should be
329,174 flights if youâ€™ve done this correctly.

```{r Q1c}

latlon <- flights %>%
  inner_join(select(airports, origin = faa, originLat = lat, originLon = lon),
    by = "origin"
  ) %>%
  inner_join(select(airports, dest = faa, destLat = lat, destLon = lon),
    by = "dest"
  )
latlon<-latlon[,c("origin","dest","originLat","originLon","destLat","destLon")]

latlon
```
# Q1d
 Use group_by and count to get the number of flights to each unique
origin/destination combination. Hint: There should be 217 of these total. 
```{r Q1d}
latlon%>%
group_by(origin,dest)%>%
  count(nrow(latlon))

```
## e.
(10 pts) Produce a map that colors each destination airport by the average air time
of its incoming flights. Here is a code snippet to draw a map of all flight
destinations, which you can use as a starting point. You may need to install the
maps packages if you have not already. Adjust the title, axis labels and aesthetics
to make this visualization as clear as possible. Hint: You may find it useful to use
a different type of join in your solution than the one in the snippet
```{r Q1e}
library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
library(wesanderson)


airports %>%
 semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
 ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
 borders("state") +
 geom_point() +
 coord_quickmap()


avg_time<- flights %>%
  group_by(dest)%>%
  summarise(average = mean(air_time,na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  inner_join(airports, by =c(dest="faa"))

avg_time %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat, colour = average) )+
  borders("state") +
  geom_point() +
  coord_quickmap() 


 


```
## Question 2.
  The result of that warm-up question is summarized in a plaintext file posted alongside this assignment.The task you have for this problem is to visualize that list on a world map, indicating in some way the cities. 
  
```{r Q2}
library(png)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

img_path <- "DS_map1.png"
img1 <- readPNG(img_path, native = TRUE, info = TRUE)
plot.new() 
rasterImage(img1,0,0,1,1)
```




## Question 3.

```{r Q3}
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)

word<-read.csv("comments.csv", header = TRUE)

```

```{r Q3_}
corp<-Corpus(VectorSource(word$Comments))


corp<- tm_map(corp,removePunctuation)
corp<- tm_map(corp,content_transformer(tolower))
corp<- tm_map(corp,removeWords,stopwords("english"))
corp<- tm_map(corp, removeNumbers)
corp<- tm_map(corp,stripWhitespace)

corp<- tm_map(corp,removeWords,c("even","cos","per","now","can","told","get","will",
                                 "got","spam","ham","females"))



t_d_m<-TermDocumentMatrix(corp)
m<-as.matrix(t_d_m)
v<-sort(rowSums(m),decreasing = TRUE)
d<- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)

wordcloud(d$word , d$freq, rot.per = 0.3,
          scale=c(4,.5),random.order = TRUE, max.words=50,
          colors= brewer.pal(10,"Dark2"))
title(main = "Word_Cloud",font.main=1,cex.main=1.5)

```
